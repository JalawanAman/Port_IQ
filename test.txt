                    The current route to Doha Port looks fine but switching to Shuaiba Port might help reduce delivery time.

                That's a classic one! The sky appears blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light. 
                Lets back here Shipment DEL-2025-146 is still pending reroute. Would you like me to handle that now?
